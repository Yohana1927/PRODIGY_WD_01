                    <br>Dunkin' Donuts, founded in 1950 by William Rosenberg in Quincy, Massachusetts, has grown into a global icon renowned for its coffee and donuts. Originally named "Open Kettle," the brand quickly evolved under the Dunkin' Donuts name, pioneering the concept of serving high-quality coffee and freshly made donuts in a fast and affordable manner. Over the decades, Dunkin' has expanded its menu to include a diverse array of baked goods, sandwiches, and beverages, all centered around its core offerings of coffee and donuts.<br><br>
                    At the heart of Dunkin' Donuts' success is its commitment to quality and innovation. The brand sources premium Arabica beans for its coffee, ensuring a consistently rich and smooth taste across its extensive range of hot and iced beverages.
